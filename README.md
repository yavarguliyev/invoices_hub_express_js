# üèó Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](./image/logical-diagram.png)

---

#### This Node.js application follows a monolithic architecture that is modular and scalable. It uses the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure that the codebase is well-organized and follows the business domain logic.

* Monolithic: While designed as a monolithic application, it's built with an architecture that supports easy splitting into microservices should the need arise.
* Modular: The application is divided into clear modules like orders, users, invoices, etc., each with its own responsibility. This makes it easy to extend the system with new features.
* Layered Architecture: It follows a typical layered architecture pattern, separating concerns into layers such as the API layer (controllers), service layer, data access layer (repositories), and domain layer (models).
* Asynchronous Processing: Worker threads and Redis are used for asynchronous processing, ensuring that long-running tasks don't block the main application flow.
* Event-Driven: The application utilizes RabbitMQ to handle domain events asynchronously, enabling decoupled communication between components.

# üß©üîÑ‚öôÔ∏èüåê Interaction Flow in DDD and Architecture

![Interaction Flow in DDD and Architecture](./image/interaction-diagram.png)

---

## 1. Domain Layer:

* The core domain logic is housed here, where entities like Order, User, and Invoice live. They represent the key concepts in the business domain.
* Operations like changing an order status or creating a user are encapsulated within these entities.

## 2. Application Layer:

* Services such as OrderService and UserService interact with domain entities to perform operations. They use repositories for data persistence.
* This layer uses patterns like Command and Observer to handle business logic and notify the system of changes.

## 3. Infrastructure Layer:

* Handles the technical details such as PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and email notifications.
* Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data, reducing load on the database.
* Worker threads handle tasks asynchronously.

## 4. API Layer:

* Exposes REST API endpoints to clients, interacting with the application layer to perform the required business logic.
* Uses ExpressJS and Swagger for routing and API documentation.

## 5. Event-Driven Communication:

* When a significant change occurs (like order approval or invoice generation), events are published to RabbitMQ to inform other systems or services.

# üß©‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏èüìê Design Patterns

##### The following design patterns have been implemented in the system to ensure modularity, flexibility, and scalability:

## 1. Singleton Pattern

* Used for: Managing service instances through `ContainerHelper`, authentication strategies in `AuthStrategiesInfrastructure`, and server instance in `ExpressServerInfrastructure`.
* Why: Ensures that only one instance of critical components is created throughout the application, reducing overhead and promoting reuse.

## 2. Factory Pattern

* Used for: Creating service instances in `ServerBootstrapper`, authentication strategies in `AuthStrategiesInfrastructure`, and task executors in `WorkerTaskHandler`.
* Why: Simplifies object creation and reduces tight coupling between components by centralizing object creation logic.

## 3. Dependency Injection (DI)

* Used for: Service registration and retrieval through `ContainerHelper`, service injection in `BaseController`, and throughout the application using TypeDI.
* Why: Decouples components and ensures that each class only knows about abstractions, not specific implementations, making testing and maintenance easier.

## 4. Observer Pattern

* Used for: Event handling through RabbitMQ subscribers (`OrderRabbitMQSubscriber`, `InvoiceRabbitMQSubscriber`, `NotificationRabbitMQSubscriber`).
* Why: Provides an efficient way to notify parts of the application about state changes and events.

## 5. Strategy Pattern

* Used for: Implementing different authentication strategies in `AuthStrategiesInfrastructure` through `BaseAuthStrategy` and `JwtAuthStrategy`.
* Why: Allows switching between different authentication methods without changing the core logic.

## 6. Command Pattern

* Used for: Handling different tasks in `WorkerTaskHandler` through `GenericTask` implementation.
* Why: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing parameterization and decoupling of command execution.

## 7. Decorator Pattern

* Used for: Event publishing through `EventPublisherDecorator` and cache invalidation through `RedisCacheInvalidateDecorator`.
* Why: Allows adding new behavior (e.g., event publishing, cache management) without modifying existing code.

## 8. Repository Pattern

* Used for: Data access abstraction in various repository classes (`OrderRepository`, `InvoiceRepository`, etc.).
* Why: Helps decouple database logic from business logic, making it easier to change or optimize data access strategies.

## 9. Builder Pattern

* Used for: Building application components in `ServerBootstrapper` and building strategies in `AuthStrategiesInfrastructure`.
* Why: Provides a flexible solution for constructing complex objects step by step.

## 10. Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

* Used for: Domain event handling through RabbitMQ infrastructure and various subscribers.
* Why: Enables asynchronous communication between components through event publishing and handling.

# üìèüß≠üí°‚öñÔ∏è Principles

##### This project follows key software design principles to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

## 1. SOLID Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and module has a single responsibility, minimizing changes and complexity.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes and modules are open for extension but closed for modification, enabling easier feature additions without breaking existing functionality.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes can be used in place of their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This helps in creating smaller, specialized interfaces.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, which is achieved through DI.

## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

* The codebase ensures that redundant logic and code are minimized. Reusable components and functions are created for common tasks such as error handling, logging, and validation.

## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

* The application follows a simple and clear architecture, avoiding unnecessary complexity in both the design and implementation. We favor simplicity and readability.

## 4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

* Only essential features and functionality are implemented. The project avoids overengineering, focusing on the current requirements.

## 5. Separation of Concerns

* The project ensures that business logic, data access, and presentation are separated. Each module is responsible for a specific concern, promoting modularity and maintainability.

## 6. Composition Over Inheritance

* The project favors composing objects and reusing behavior through composition rather than relying heavily on inheritance.
